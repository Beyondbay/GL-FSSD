Great learning Full stack development projects
Started a Full Stack Development course last year but had to pause due to work and family demands. Rejoined the new batch last month and now fully committed. I'm applying knowledge from other platforms like Odin and freeCodeCamp, and will be pushing all my projects to GitHub to track progress and growth.
